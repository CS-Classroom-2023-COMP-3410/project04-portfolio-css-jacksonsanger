## Reflection

This assignment was really fun. I wanted to change my website to be programming-themed, with the same color scheme as an "Oh My Zsh" terminal. I mixed this theme with a little bit of a "hacker" theme as well. 

I decided to go with Bulma as my framework. I like the simplicity of the framework, which made it easier to override with a lot of my own custom animations, colors, and fonts in my custom `styles.css` file. I also really liked that Bulma made the hamburger navbar menu super easy to implement. Finally, I liked how Bulma is designed for mobile first, so my design would be guaranteed to look good on mobile.

I had some difficulties getting used to using Bulma at first. I had to dig around in the docs quite a bit to get a feel for it and figure out what the different classes did. Once I got the hang of it, I was able to use sections and containers to organize my pages and ensure everything was responsive. Containers made it easy to center content and control the width of the page for different screen sizes, and sections made it easy to add responsive padding to each section.

My development process was fairly simple. I first developed my landing page using Bulma to get the layout looking how I wanted, then I wrote my own `styles.css` sheet to get the color scheme and all of the special effects (hovering effects, animations, etc.) looking how I wanted on my landing page. ChatGPT helped a little bit with the cool animations and hover effects. Then, I applied these CSS scripts (the Bulma CSS and my custom CSS) to my other pages. With just these links at the top, the other pages were already looking a lot better. I just had to do some small tweaks to the HTML and the CSS to straighten out some of the minor errors. 

Some of the challenges I faced were image sizing and layout issues. After applying the CSS, the images were not where I wanted them to be and often looked stretched. I had to adjust the HTML and use some of Bulma's image classes to help with this. I also had a tough time with iframes. They would scroll and wouldn't resize properly, but after some trial and error, I figured out how to use custom CSS with aspect ratios to make them look good on all screen sizes.

Overall, it was awesome to be able to get my website working as a responsive layout. Using Bulma made it super easy to do that, and the sections and containers were a huge help. I even visited the site on my phone, and I think it looks great on mobile too.
